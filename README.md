# Star Intel Document Spec

This python package defines python dataclasses so your project will be abled to create valid Starintel documents

Starintel is a WIP framework to allow a osint operator to collect and add metadata to information. weather it is from message bots or data breaches it is up to you to get it there.
Once you have the data you will be abled to explore it or search it with a WIP web app. cli/api is on the roadmap.

The documents are stored in Apache Couchdb version 3.
